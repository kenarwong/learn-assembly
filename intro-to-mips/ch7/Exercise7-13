# I believe this rounding method is incorrect

# 12 / 5 = 2.4
# Quotient = 2, Remainder = 2

# Take remainder from division
# 12 Mod 5 = 2

# Divide original divisor by this number
# 5 / 2 = 2.5

# If new quotient >= 1, add 1 to original quotient, otherwise do not change original quotient
# 2.5 > 1, so add 1 to original quotient
# 2 + 1 = 3

# 2.4 does not round up to 3

# Correct method
# If new quotient >= 2, add 1 to original quotient, otherwise do not change original quotient
# The ratio of the divisor/remainder should be >= 2
# Because a decimal of >= .5 would be a remainder/divisor ratio of >= 1/2.
