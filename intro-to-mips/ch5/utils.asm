# subprogram:     PrintInt
# author:         Charles W. Kann
# purpose:        To print a string to the console
# input:          $a0 - The address of the string to print.
#                 $a1 - The value of the int to print
# side effects:   The String is printed followed by the integer value.

# author:         Charles W. Kann
# purpose:        To print the user for an integer input, and
